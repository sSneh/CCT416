,,,"It's over and those jobs won't be coming back. Years ago when below-the-line was cut, actors and writers sat back and didn't give shits about it because they felt secure. They need to start clawing at revenue from their future AI likeness, instead trying to retain the old way."

,,,/ Hey Guys! Just a note.. I'm all about Fandom and fan subs. But AI makes things weird. Cloning an actors voice without their knowledge from a show w/ AI and then creating a bunch of new media with it and posting it is not cool. That is someone's livelihood. Use ur own voice

,,,"This is indeed terrifying. Very much so. I want actors, writers, directors, EVERYONE on a project to be living, breathing humans. Steven Hawking was right to warn us about AI in"
,,,"Fascinating tweets about the shocking future of the entertainment business in light of AI. Actors, writers, even drivers out of work."
,,,"So then what is all the AI imagery of humans we've been seeing? And even if it can't, most actors can't simulate a whole human either, so I'm not exactly sure what that has to do with acting."
,,,My conversation with chatgpt about &amp; other AI really scared me. The speed &amp; evolution &amp; lack of guardrails! We live in a world with bad actors with malicious intent everywhere. We should be extremely cautious with how we proceed with AGI. 
,,,"AI will never take over the world when we get rid of bad actors such as . Ugh, what an embarrassment. "
,,,Not many actors I'd prefer to see as AI renditions.
,,,"With our provenance initiative, we hope to steer the generative AI ecosystem towards decentralization where it matters, put creators in charge of their creations, and foster composability and interoperability among the many actors in this growing field."
,,,So I need to play with it a bit more: But I combined all the Superman Actors from the last ish years into one Amalgamated Superman in the AI Art both and this is what I got
,,,To all the voice actors and audible voices losing their jobs to AI. Use AI to flood content. Writers will sadly lose their jobs as well. Publish on open source. Let chaos rule the world. Elden Lord.
,,,"""Bad actors might use AI to change people's voting habits, that's why only I should be able to distrivute powerful AI"" - man who created obviously left leaning AI"
,,,"AI is a bit like a developmental vaccine that goes wrong, gets out into the commercial &amp; public space &amp; mutates (via self learning) into independent &amp; bad faith actors causing catastrophic damage to trust in social, financial &amp; technological &amp; information infrastructure"
,,,"OPPORTUNITY!!! Anyone want to have their voice in a Doctor Who animation? Plenty of time till it comes out, and plenty of time till I get to the episode I want actors for but I wanna start using some real actors rather than AI. Won't need to have loads of lines. Lmk!"
,,,"I'd like to be able to use AI for those books that cannot be economically recorded by live actors due to low interest, but I hope this publisher utterly fails in this decision."
,,,"This is why you gotta keep AI out of Hollywood, having actors appear in movies they didnt agree to star in is disrespectful to an actors legacy"
,,,He is Ai generated with different actors playing live role at various events.
,,,Why!? Once youre dead youre dead. Hanks isnt that great of an actor I would want to see after he dies. Let new better actors get the credit. And definitely not by AI.
,,,I'm going to go ahead and start blocking all advertisements that use AI actors instead of hiring someone. Cheap choices = cheap prpduct
,,,Yup we no longer need actors - AI can handle it without the woke whining
,,,"Looking it up, Justine Bateman is actually advocating that SAG in its next contract create iron-clad rules protecting actors from being used for AI projects in the future as well as from working on projects created by AI. And she has a computer science degree. And is against AI."
,,,"I agree, however, i think the argument is flawed because the answer from these corpos will be ""well we'll just say AI actors need to be 'paid' % more than their living counterpart, with that % going to SAG"""
,,,The new EU A.I. act if passed could lead to banning open source AI development. : ArtificialInteligence The Internet is about to get a crash course in gun and drug law logic when the AI prohibitions start rolling out and only bad actors have them.
,,,"While this is showcasing the current unnatural feel of AI, this is basically acting, including in ways that actors don't even have to think about. It's not there yet, but years ago this would have been impossible."
,,,"Neil, ; shutting down AI would be very bad policy (and would give non US companies and state actors a significant advantage over us) but how would/could this be policed? im hopeful (wishful?) the hysteria will pass quickly."
,,,"I % agree.. To be honest, I'm not seeing a pretty picture of AI in the future.. Especially when bad actors are involved!"
,,,He wont appear! His digital image will! Real actors and actresses will be early casualties of AI!
,,,There's a thread connected to that and it's very scary. It talks about a future of 'made to order' AI films that completely cut the writers and actors out of the process.
,,,Bad actors inevitably exploit every new technology for nefarious ends. See how cybercriminals are taking advantage of the AI boom:
,,,Im Pretty Sure The Executives &amp; Lawyers Are Already Drawing Up Ai Contracts To Fuk The Actors Out Of Money
,,,I dont think Martin would like whats cinema is going to turn into. Its all going to be unpaid AI generated films with the production companies stealing well known actors voices and creating their own films. Weve already seen a massive decline in movies in the last decade
,,,AI is replacing audio book voice actors.
,,,Actually we wont need these narcissistic actors at all. AI and CGI. By by Hollywood elites.
,,,Why use actual actors' likenesses? AI should make unique looks for movies.
,,,"Young actors should probably be striking, considering old actors are just gonna live forever now through AI."
,,,"Thinking about how AI will change Hollywood. First, no more actors or writers, makeup people, production crews. Eventually it will become so affordable to create exciting content, we'll be back to weekly or even daily episodes of our favorite shows. May have some need for"
,,,"AI would be great for monotonous assembly-line jobs- but bad actors could use Your Voice, parent or child's to Steal Money from You! Bad actors can use it to purposely put out Disinformation using politicians faces &amp; voices. We wouldn't know who or what to believe-some don't now."
,,,"Beyond bias, the deliberate Data Poisoning of AI models by bad actors completely corrupts AI outputs. The scary thing is that you wont necessarily know the data your models have been trained on have been poisoned."
,,,"right!! no ai can fully express emotions as a real actor does, its ruining the art of it and its awful im hoping that audience reviews are horrible too bc not only will aspiring actors be screwed but also well known actors in the industry will be without a job"
,,,"Beyond bias, the deliberate Data Poisoning of AI models by bad actors completely corrupts AI outputs."
,,,"is best in blockchain analytics. Its AI model aids Risk management, data analysis, ID verification avoiding bad actors, and analyzing users' on-chain history. Become a holder of $CGPT and expect a x soon."
,,,"Can AI replace screenwriters, directors, and even actors? This chaotic AI-generated beer commercial shows the technology isnt quite there yet."
,,,"I don't understand why the AI safety crowd focuses on the ""AI is smarter than us and becomes independent problem"", when the ""AI is smarter than us and that can be abused by bad actors and will lead to societal problems"" is as much of an existential threat but much more relatable."
,,,I'm looking forward to AI taking over ALL actors' jobs so we don't have to listen to their politics any longer and Hollyweird disappears.
,,,"AI art is going to make the copyright regime even worse by strait up allowing the owning of prompts for genres and actors and styles,now that such things can be codified into a machine"
,,,You know what I could get behind in terms of AI? Creating programs for voice actors so that they actually say your username in story-driven RPG games Or a program in-game that can copy your voice that allows your character to speak like you (as a setting pref)
,,,The senate committee today on AI was so focused on misinformation that they failed drill into the major risks like that is manipulated by bad actors with vast resources. Societies are vulnerable in so many ways ie: critical infrastructure virus attacks
,,,+ + + = your talk on the dangers of AI raises crucial concerns about the potential for bad actors to spread misinformation and disrupt elections and society. This is precisely why we need Open Beneficial A
,,,"I'm hearing studios though are asking actors to relinquish ""voice rights"" for lack of a better term to let AI recreate their voices for movie dubs! The tech may not be there yet, but it might be closer than we think."
,,,Audiobook narrators say AI is already taking away business as voice actors are replaced with AI software ..
,,,Wish the industry would've listened to what Chris Evans wrote almost years ago. AI is now a threat to what we do as actors in film &amp; television/streaming. The notion of AI being considered as an alternative is disrespectful. The art of acting is about the HUMAN condition
,,,"Luke for sure. Season and bobf were cgi tests for him. They even asked the actors to use their voices with AI after their death. I believe Hamill or Jobes said, its okay if their family gets the movie then."
,,,Ai vlice acting takes jobs away from Voice actors and is unethical
,,,"What isn't old is the current Vallance/HMG mandated process, which surely stretches credulity. The idea that 'bad actors' in AI (or even good ones) will comply with some hastily scrambled together code of practice, is delusional. Going to be an interesting summer!"
,,,"Wait for the more widespread use of AI. All actors, including those of African descent so beloved of ad makers, will be surplus to requirements and learning the art of forming an orderly queue."
,,,"I don't see it that way. I know that bad actors will take it over seas &amp; develop their weapons against people. I simply say any deployment on US soil is mandatory yrs. Maybe you can have a board of experts approve. I think AI has it's place in diagnosis, weather, seismic, etc"
,,,"This is right up there with that Michael Jordan movie that only features his shoe. Looks like we dont need AI to make polished bad ideas, just former actors turned directors.."
,,,"No studio space, office space, crew, actors, writersNothing. If ANYONE would watch AI content, and they would, the corporation behind them would profit ENORMOUSLY. It seems pretty inevitable honestly. Its just a question now as to whether or not the workers can stop it"
,,,"Even better-put, Angus! The AI convo is like a mix of worrying that Pro Tools would end music as we know it PLUS the fear from the era of Jurassic Park-era CGI putting all human actors out of work, plus a pinch of inferiority complex."
,,,"AI (a blatant misnomer) will be great for humanity (except for certain job and career path devaluations). AGI (G for general) on the other hand, will potentially become destructive (think how bad actors view bio weapons)"
,,,"AI and ML, in the hands of bad faith actors is a cancer, it will spread, it will mutate, and it will affect everything and anything it can without a care for who might object to it. Not making a stand to regulate this now will cost us so much."
,,,"Actor or AI? Tom Hanks Thinks Audiences May Not Care I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and thats it, but my performances can go on and on and on and on and on, he continued, citing AI technology."" "
,,,That ALSO had the technical chops to comment on this makes her thread SO much more important for actors and all those in entertainment sleeping on the AI threat.
,,,"The thing that gets me about Ai is things: . It denies for older actors and artists to truly die, as people with Ai will constantly rehash their work. . In the coming years, it will deny any new talent from coming into the fold, as that will constitute ""risk""."
,,,I'm pretty sure whatever AI keeps making these only knows a handful of actors because it keeps casting the same people in every one
,,,"The film industry as a whole is pretty weird, especially Hollywood is infested by Satanists. In the next to years, we will see a shift in all industry, once AI has passed a maturity cycle. We will longer need a film crew or voice actors,etc. Only the script writer/director"
,,,"When Im asked to express my opinion on the perils of AI, I dont worry much about cheating and the demise of teaching. I worry about things like this and what state actors can and will do with the power of LLMs."
,,,I read her tweet thread last night and it's FRIGHTENING. Surrender your likeness to be used to be AI generated whenever they feel like it? Who would want to watch AI actors over actual human beings anyway - how bizarre would that be? These ideas are just nuts
,,,"Somewhere on my hard drive I have a half-finished novella about a recovered alcoholic who is part of a ""Creator's Guild"" and makes films using expression/gesture actors and AI-generated models and backgrounds. But when he's offered the chance to use a black market AI to recreate"
,,,Theyre going to use AI to write % reality programming that they will then hire all non-SAG actors for. Its a win-win.
,,,Very interesting thread on where AI is heading and the implications for actors
,,,"Yes, the hearing, while in some respects not terrible, was too focused on what COULD happen &amp; how AI might be abused by BAD actors. Pretty silent on present harms &amp; how AI actors, like Altman, are responsible for building a system through exploitative labor practices."
,,,"thousands of actors over the years have played Hamlet theyre all playing a different Hamlet because theyre all distinct, unique individuals who breathe their own life into the words an AI voice generator replicating their vocal patterns isnt giving us a new take on Hamlet"
,,,"People actively involved w AI heartily warning regulations, guidelines, transparency absolutely necessary. Beware of counterfeit people, manipulation, false information, AI hallucinations, bad actors, election manipulation &amp; ordering chemistry to create novel biological agents."
,,,"If I was an actor, this would be frightening. It's a long thread about the threat of AI to actors."
,,,"Tech pioneer Geoffrey Hinton. one of the key people behind AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, recently left Google. He fears AI may be used to create fake or fraudulent content in the future in the future. Learn more: "
,,,"CNews AI will be the end of us: the combination of bad actors and politicians who dont have the capability to understand what is needed to control it means we are, ultimately, screwed. In terms of jobs in the shorter term, though, it shows the need for universal basic income."
,,,This whole thread..Im so glad that I didnt sign with SAG yet because actors along with writers need to be protected and paid. And if more people are going to be using AI for an actors image than people this is going to be a huge problem.
,,,"The movie The Congress is about this very thing, actors signing over their image to be used with AI."
,,,"Hey, actors. This is a slippery slope. How long before your likeness ends up in an AI created porn movie? It's a real possibility, especially if these companies sell your likeness to others. Imagine you're long dead and your grandkids are watching grandma in a gangbang. Beware."
,,,"In addition, the rejection AI is encountering in some areas is a much bigger problem than bad actors taking control of the system. If we can agree to accept it, then we can begin teaching the public. This would provide room for initial information about the good and bad."
,,,"I, naively, though AI wouldn't be a threat to the creatives out there: writers, musicians, artists, actors, etc. Turns out I was very, very wrong."
,,,"Could this reach across all media.... more than likely. We could be seeing a ton of cgi generated politicians, actors, or sports figures. Even the potus. But we knew this already...."
,,,I see this attempt to license AI as a huge deal. You don't lean into regulatory barriers for new entrants if there's no chance that other actors can follow in your footsteps. You do it if it's relatively easy to do so. OpenAI knows something.
,,,"There are ways in a vacuum, are there ways that can actually manifest with the current actors? I very much doubt it. Cant disprove it of course, but we have the pandemic right there in the rear view mirror. The latency on losing authoritarian tendencies isnt years."
,,,this is basically moloch rearing it's head. i think there are ways we could slow down elements of the pipeline and up the investment into interprebility without letting bad actors take over
,,,What will be the future once AI will start making movies without actual actors!!!! Whole industry will be affected badly.
