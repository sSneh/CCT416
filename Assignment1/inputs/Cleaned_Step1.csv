,,,So they will protest and Hollywood will die. The new Hollywood will be scripts by AI using non union actors.
,,,AI does not cause productivity loss due to labor disruption. What leverage do writers and actors think they have to negotiate with?
,,,"They are trying to strike about this at the wrong time imo. AI is an augmentation tool currently. Making films better and faster, only replacing redundant work. They have been able to recreate actors with cgi for a while now. No AI needed, AI will makes it cheaper. Next?"
,,,Do they believe that an SEC-like regulatory body should be formed to keep AI out of the hands of bad actors?

,,,"I dont think people are gonna get into AI movies and actors. Unless the AI gets so good theyre able to trick people into thinking the actors are real. It will have to be a really big lie with AI awards shows, celebrity gossip media about AI actors all propping up this lie."
,,,"And on top of it all, actors who never get sick, dont need pension and health, get into culture war scandals. Just pay a image license fee to their estates and a script made by AI with no residuals or line item paysthats where it is going. I dont want it to be but it is."
,,,"AI's evolution leaves me speechless, and it just did a mic drop with DragGAN. With this groundbreaking technology, you become the director, and pixels are your actors. Play with poses, tweak shapes, and rearrange reality with a simple drag. Mind-blowing."
,,,"AI is a threat to writers, actors and directors"
,,,This shit is an insult to voice actors. Say no to AI
,,,Thanks for proving just why we need to be backing these writers and actors who are striking against the use of Ai. By dropping this hideous ass video she has single-handedly showed us why its important to keep REAL creatives in the storytelling seats of Hollywood.
,,,See u showed us what Keanu showed us they dont need actors no more to act they got ai ti take ur jobs now
,,,More and more you sound like you're working for bad actors. Now you're harvesting people's voices? Why? To be able to AI and make compromising recordings? Sounds nefarious. PUBLIC: BEWARE
,,,"I'm not saying that Youtubers aren't creators, but like the actors, they are the last one that will be bothered by AI. They all will have the live easier, especially when they are already so rich, while we all die."

,,,It's the not just the actors and writers etc. that will be replaced by Ai it's the big movie studios themselves. People will be able to create movies from their bedrooms.
,,,"Protesting only going to accelerate the use of AI. See: McDonalds That being said, this could spark a niche of creators that want to make their own movies with real actors (be the change you wish to see)"

,,,"There will be no actors in the future. Why? Because we have enough Actor Icons that are manifested in your movie history. So, as she pointed out correctly, for the movie industry it will be much more easy to create movies with the help of AI instead of using real humans as actors"
,,,"Regrettably, AGI is coming for all of us. Actors are going to find out that script writing is easily done by AI and that actors images or a new actor can be produced by computers. Many of the so called stars who have acted entitled, will shortly be out of work."
,,,What did voice actors do to make Ai makers be there nr haters
,,,"Yes, AI will be better at that, if it isnt already. Through the internet and other channels we are constantly feeding it information about how we humans think, so AI can use that in ways human actors never could."

,,,"Some people in the AI risk movement say we have common cause with other groups who want to slow down AI, such as actors going on strike. Nothing could be further from the truth. () I want these people to be permanently unemployed and on a basic income because I don't want their"
,,,"The reason this pisses me the fuck off is it could so easily be used to take advantage of new actors. They would own that voice and I dont want to sign that away if Im capable of doing it, AI does not sound convincing, and its just a slippery slope."
,,,"I hate this, bigger video game companies will probably still employ high-profile talent, like Troy Baker who voices Joel Miller in The Last of Us, but AI will give smaller games studios easier access to voices and give early-career actors more work"
,,,"If the voice actors were absent, the AI wouldn't exist cause it needs them to steal voices from hope that helps"

,,,Are anime voice actors going to be downsized as AI progresses (I think this is a conversation that needs to be had)
,,,She aced it!! She committed to creating the total AI generic look in plastic surgery. I guess self-worth on a name tag is not all that bad while the swelling goes down. Actors/actresses are looking more and more similar to each other. Doppelgangers. AI. It's not pretty.
,,,if anime voice actors were replaced by ai that would sound and feel wierddd!!

,,,i dont think sports will happen because we like betting and the live aspect of it lol but its crazy but AI will make things faster and cheaper . maybe actors can sell their IP via nft or something and get revenue from AI lol
,,,"There is actually a fascinating aspect to AI, especially for actors. Contracts allow studios to use whatever they film in any way without compensation. So if Universal has Brad Pitt films and makes an AI Brad, can they use him as much as they want and never have to pay him.?"
,,,"Are voice actors part of the WGA strikes or the Hollywood actors strike vote? Because generative AI is about to rob this profession as well. No need to use local talent for language translation and dubbing or even for games and anime, just clone a voice. Another sector of the"
,,,"To be completely clear, I do believe AI x-risk is absolutely real and critically under-addressed. But this is a realistic scenario for hope, assuming competent actors with the right incentives can pull it off"
,,,"What the actual fuck... Voice Actors, no matter where deserve as much respect as artists for their craft, and this happens. AI tech doesn't need to be regulated it needs to be banned."
,,,"AI is replacing actors, anchors and others"
,,,"Even if WE stop our advances in AI because of the potential dangers, bad actors wouldn't stop their progress which would lead to good people having poor AI than bad people eventually. We should be more scared of that. Amazing talk by Sal Khan!"

,,,Whats next? Theres gonna replace real life actors with ai cgi actors?
,,,Hahah wtf how does AI replace human actors?
,,,What next AI actors?
,,,"AI will replace everything until it gets to the lawyers and political class, along with ""news"" casters. Once their jobs are threatened it becomes serious. I think the actors should learn to code...oh wait, that's being replaced by AI too."
,,,"...No one was complaining when it was the SAs. Now its the actors they're kicking off?! Go back to acting on stage, should be a while before AI takes over there"

,,,"The fact *you* don't think it's rational implies nothing about other actors who, believe it or not, don't necessarily share your priors. All an actor needs is a belief that one more epoch of training presents no x-risk but possible AI superiority for it to be rational to train."

,,,I dont have any problem if Hollywood actors/ directors/ scripters are replaced by AI. It should be ended indeed.
,,,theyve even resorted to modelling AI after late voice actors; completely unethical and disrespectful to the ones that came before us
,,,"Fun fact, a lot of these AI voice generators pay voice actors to lend their voices to generate more voices with, so if you're a voice actor and you're taking on AI voice cloning projects for money...you're dumb. This is just the start."
,,,"It's over and those jobs won't be coming back. Years ago when below-the-line was cut, actors and writers sat back and didn't give shits about it because they felt secure. They need to start clawing at revenue from their future AI likeness, instead trying to retain the old way."

,,,Hollywood writers and actors been trash for a long time maybe ai will improve it. You would think bots have been writing films for the past years already
,,,All this AI voice generator stuff is worrying and infuriating. Why would you want to replace the voice actors who work so hard to create something beautiful and meaningful? Why would you want to give up that passion and the genuine human emotions that they provide?

,,,"it is not beneficial to actors in any way for them to be like yeah we can just use AI to have you say a different line in post, or look like you speak Japanese when you dont. its just as dangerous"
,,,oh for sure. I predict in the next couple years there's going to be a highly promoted blockbuster movie with nothing but AI actors
,,,"TLDR, theyre snake oil salesmen selling Hollywood a tool they DONT need - using AI to make the actors faces look like they match the dub in other languages or when dialogue changes."
,,,Who is cloning these actors with AI?
,,,Writers be like... I'm going on strike! Don't replace me with AI while I am gone?! Screen Actors Guild take notice!

,,,"I would love a Star Wars show that starred Luke, Leia, and Han after Return of the Jedi, I dont care one bit if it is all CGI actors and AI voices, I want to see more stories with the characters I care about, at the same time absolutely keep making new stuff too"
,,,"Any danger introduced by civilian bad actors using AI will be dwarfed by government bad actors (ours and others) which regulation will not prevent. The only solution I see is to publicly and openly run towards the danger, fail fast, and hope we learn faster than the bad actors."
,,,"Thanks. Honestly, I don't know how actors make a living in Hollywood given producers/studios are so finicky. AI is scary on many levels too. I can blame anyone in the industry going on strike."
,,,"Obtain new skills like the rest of us and get another job, or collect royalties by licensing your image/voice, etc out to companies leveraging AI creatively for them to use in their creations. Just because youre actors doesnt mean youre exempt from obselence. Adapt"
,,,Fully agree with with the dangers of AI not just from AGI but from rogue/evil actors. We need regulation and we need it now. Just like nuclear bomb proliferation esp. dirty bombs its not unrealistic to see a future bad actor(s) commit horrific crimes and chaos with AI
,,,As a WGA member I dont think youre taking into consideration that were fighting to save the industry. AI can replace writers and actors and every below the line production member goes with it. You think its sanitized now? The Guild will win with solidarity
,,,"Hot take, actors are over payed. Maybe AI is making us all face the music"
,,,Yeah this whole AI thing just doesn't make sense for voice actors just to clone there voice it's just lazy besides you're not going to get % accuracy of a machine
,,,"This is exactly my question. I think we need a general consensus from the public on how far we go. Again, I'm not against AI, I love what I'm able to do with it, but I see how bad actors can distort the outcome. That's my concern."
,,,I partially agree with Yann LeCun. There is much catastrophizing about AI. But I also think his statements are too absolute and deserve some qualifiers. Many bad actors want to use AI in bad ways which could lead to quite bad outcomes.
,,,"they dont need to use likeness, they can make better looking, more fitting looking for the roll, ai generated actors"
,,,"to further their asshole capitalist gains to shut out OTHER tech people, writers and actors. WE are not more important then the careful PROCESS that is NEEDED to sort out AI and sort out all the precautions that need to be taken with it. -"

,,,"I think AI should be fine as long as the actors get paid for the use of their voice and theres a safety clause that legally voids the contract if used incorrectly. But yeah, having the actual VAs produces better content."
,,,"Couldn't give a fkk been around ""actors"" and a few of those ckkcssckers, literally the worst type of humans I've met. Its on you to show that ai products can't compete. Same w/ attorney etc..w/ all of us. Ai tears thru a lot of fluff - all those people laughed off truckers"

,,,"is currently using voice actors' voices illegally with AI. ""Pokemon Cosmic Quest"" has made videos on YouTube illegally using myself, James Carter Cathcart, and Rodger Parsons' voices illegally."
,,,I dont know if actors have realized yet that AI is going to make fake people on screen that wont have get paid. Goodbye commercial actors.
,,,the question then for the movie studios becomes is it an economically better long term decision to invest in generative ai tools now instead of meeting the actors demands. i would guess for some the answer would be yes.
,,,Would you watch a movie if all actors were AI?
,,,Whoa! that's not good to put out the hard work actors and replacing them with an computer engineering Ai ?? Wtf this not good way to Start off. Smh oh god check this out

,,,"I mean, im not mad actors and elites produce crap anyway anymore, they really did it to themselves some industries need to die and be rebirthed. Maybe AI is a means to the death of an old industry to make a fresh beginning for a new human one"
,,,Hey I have a complex question: do you know if these laws will apply for ai voices? Like preventing corporations from using ai generated voice instead of voice actors? And what about live action ai generated scenes? Theres been use of ai to abuse the power to send false-
,,,/ Hey Guys! Just a note.. I'm all about Fandom and fan subs. But AI makes things weird. Cloning an actors voice without their knowledge from a show w/ AI and then creating a bunch of new media with it and posting it is not cool. That is someone's livelihood. Use ur own voice
,,,I do not want AI to steal what is original voice from the actors who has worked so many years and that their personality came with their voice that we hear each days on the tv. I for one do not want my kids grow up to only recognize Al who replaces their childhood-
,,,"Hollywood will never give up it's actors, far too many people with money, red shoes and horrifying inclinations that need a supply of wannabes to feed on AI just doesn't fullfill a movie producers needs...."
,,,"To be completely honest. I dont care much. To much propaganda has infected the scripts anyway. And the actors, scriptwriters and producers don't care about that. So this means that the good movies and series will now become great again. No propaganda, no soulless AI. Pure talent."
,,,"I would be fine with AI used for every movie, no more leftist airhead actors at all"
,,,"AI is bigger than Kenyans are willing to admit. The disruptions from AI will cause mass layoffs. In Hollywood, actors and directors are on strike presently. Think whether your job can be replaced"
,,,"The issue with AI pods/commercials/new Sapranos is I imagine that all new actors, singers, etc., will sign their likenesses away before theyre famous to be in a project. So no specific release for use in one localized ad-read. Studios will pivot to new talent. Imagine MCU"
,,,We welcome the AI Lords! Gather up the actors - learn to code.
,,,"My take on AI risk: acceleration of existential risk requires resources and energy, and likely people. We know people can be commandeered but it still takes time and money, such that largest threat is from bad actors and other opportunists, which is the same issue we face already"
,,,Im cool with watching all AI film and TV. Dont really like actors and actresses all that much to begin with.
,,,"a twitter space called ""can AI actually help voice actors?"" and it's just me saying ""no"" repeatedly for hours"

,,,"Midjourney uses Discord), reads the technical write-up. This vacuum has been exploited by threat actors looking to drive AI app-seekers to imposter web pages promoting fake apps. ."
,,,"I think the writers going on strike have the right idea but they cannot do it alone. Musicians, artists, actors, and the like could also go on strike and demand a ban on the use of AI by studios. Hobbyists and those just messing around with it would still be able to use it though"
,,,"Rogan:""actors are there to entertain us, thats it !"" this actress doesnt have an art of ""storytelling"" the writers and ai write the stories. lol computergames are So Much more fun than movies. Im team ai on this"

,,,"The fears of AI is really about capitalism. Realistically, writers are afraid that we'll have to re-write crappy AI but keep none of the ownership or protections since it's a ""rewrite"" Movies will have actors, but ADR, reshoots, promotion could be AI &amp; actors won't get paid"
,,,"Actors will be replaced by AI too. Because theyve developed the ability to make actor AI , advanced cinematography Writers by CHATGPT So a complete synthetic version or people in existence will have no Jobs Like I Said - in person concerts and in person things are the"

,,,Screen Actors Guild set to join Writers on strike one of the biggest issues is Ai using actors likenesses.

,,,"Great thread for people who dont understand what WGA/SAG are fighting for. And per the post below, I talked to a friend recently, theyre head of a studio, and they told me they plan on buying AI voices instead of using actors moving forward. I was heartbroken"

,,,seeing the pattern of big corporations deleting content/services and wondering what is going on and if it has anything to do with investment in AI and punishing real artists/writers/actors in a time of unions/guilds and replacing stuff with GenAI content?
,,,The risk is not AI taking over as no one is even close to that or any kind of AGI at the moment but misuse of the current tech by bad actors&gt; how is licensing going to solve that? Its red tape gibberish. You basically want more paper work to approve large language models
,,,"Now is this AI learning and will that be used in the future to replace on screen actors? Maybe? We need to put some checks and balances in place and advertise/label AI altered work as just that, but I think Pandora's box is open on this one. Time for damage control."
,,,"I think it's adding admin jobs to process the AI adjustments, but, no, they would still need foreign language voice actors. The video in the article is pretty cool. Original language versions will still be distributed with subtitles."

,,,"Actors, AI staged isant that what your response would have been lol"

,,,I dont think Martin would like whats cinema is going to turn into. Its all going to be unpaid AI generated films with the production companies stealing well known actors voices and creating their own films. Weve already seen a massive decline in movies in the last decade
,,,AI is replacing audio book voice actors.
,,,Actually we wont need these narcissistic actors at all. AI and CGI. By by Hollywood elites.
,,,Why use actual actors' likenesses? AI should make unique looks for movies.
,,,"Young actors should probably be striking, considering old actors are just gonna live forever now through AI."
,,,"Thinking about how AI will change Hollywood. First, no more actors or writers, makeup people, production crews. Eventually it will become so affordable to create exciting content, we'll be back to weekly or even daily episodes of our favorite shows. May have some need for"
,,,"AI would be great for monotonous assembly-line jobs- but bad actors could use Your Voice, parent or child's to Steal Money from You! Bad actors can use it to purposely put out Disinformation using politicians faces &amp; voices. We wouldn't know who or what to believe-some don't now."
,,,"Beyond bias, the deliberate Data Poisoning of AI models by bad actors completely corrupts AI outputs. The scary thing is that you wont necessarily know the data your models have been trained on have been poisoned."
,,,"right!! no ai can fully express emotions as a real actor does, its ruining the art of it and its awful im hoping that audience reviews are horrible too bc not only will aspiring actors be screwed but also well known actors in the industry will be without a job"
,,,"Beyond bias, the deliberate Data Poisoning of AI models by bad actors completely corrupts AI outputs."
,,,"is best in blockchain analytics. Its AI model aids Risk management, data analysis, ID verification avoiding bad actors, and analyzing users' on-chain history. Become a holder of $CGPT and expect a x soon."
,,,"Can AI replace screenwriters, directors, and even actors? This chaotic AI-generated beer commercial shows the technology isnt quite there yet."
,,,"I don't understand why the AI safety crowd focuses on the ""AI is smarter than us and becomes independent problem"", when the ""AI is smarter than us and that can be abused by bad actors and will lead to societal problems"" is as much of an existential threat but much more relatable."
,,,I'm looking forward to AI taking over ALL actors' jobs so we don't have to listen to their politics any longer and Hollyweird disappears.
,,,"AI art is going to make the copyright regime even worse by strait up allowing the owning of prompts for genres and actors and styles,now that such things can be codified into a machine"
,,,You know what I could get behind in terms of AI? Creating programs for voice actors so that they actually say your username in story-driven RPG games Or a program in-game that can copy your voice that allows your character to speak like you (as a setting pref)
,,,The senate committee today on AI was so focused on misinformation that they failed drill into the major risks like that is manipulated by bad actors with vast resources. Societies are vulnerable in so many ways ie: critical infrastructure virus attacks
,,,+ + + = your talk on the dangers of AI raises crucial concerns about the potential for bad actors to spread misinformation and disrupt elections and society. This is precisely why we need Open Beneficial A
,,,"I'm hearing studios though are asking actors to relinquish ""voice rights"" for lack of a better term to let AI recreate their voices for movie dubs! The tech may not be there yet, but it might be closer than we think."
,,,Audiobook narrators say AI is already taking away business as voice actors are replaced with AI software ..
,,,Wish the industry would've listened to what Chris Evans wrote almost years ago. AI is now a threat to what we do as actors in film &amp; television/streaming. The notion of AI being considered as an alternative is disrespectful. The art of acting is about the HUMAN condition
,,,"Luke for sure. Season and bobf were cgi tests for him. They even asked the actors to use their voices with AI after their death. I believe Hamill or Jobes said, its okay if their family gets the movie then."
,,,Ai vlice acting takes jobs away from Voice actors and is unethical
,,,"What isn't old is the current Vallance/HMG mandated process, which surely stretches credulity. The idea that 'bad actors' in AI (or even good ones) will comply with some hastily scrambled together code of practice, is delusional. Going to be an interesting summer!"
,,,"Wait for the more widespread use of AI. All actors, including those of African descent so beloved of ad makers, will be surplus to requirements and learning the art of forming an orderly queue."
,,,"I don't see it that way. I know that bad actors will take it over seas &amp; develop their weapons against people. I simply say any deployment on US soil is mandatory yrs. Maybe you can have a board of experts approve. I think AI has it's place in diagnosis, weather, seismic, etc"
,,,"This is right up there with that Michael Jordan movie that only features his shoe. Looks like we dont need AI to make polished bad ideas, just former actors turned directors.."
,,,"No studio space, office space, crew, actors, writersNothing. If ANYONE would watch AI content, and they would, the corporation behind them would profit ENORMOUSLY. It seems pretty inevitable honestly. Its just a question now as to whether or not the workers can stop it"
,,,"Even better-put, Angus! The AI convo is like a mix of worrying that Pro Tools would end music as we know it PLUS the fear from the era of Jurassic Park-era CGI putting all human actors out of work, plus a pinch of inferiority complex."
,,,"AI (a blatant misnomer) will be great for humanity (except for certain job and career path devaluations). AGI (G for general) on the other hand, will potentially become destructive (think how bad actors view bio weapons)"
,,,"AI and ML, in the hands of bad faith actors is a cancer, it will spread, it will mutate, and it will affect everything and anything it can without a care for who might object to it. Not making a stand to regulate this now will cost us so much."
,,,"Actor or AI? Tom Hanks Thinks Audiences May Not Care I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and thats it, but my performances can go on and on and on and on and on, he continued, citing AI technology."" "
,,,That ALSO had the technical chops to comment on this makes her thread SO much more important for actors and all those in entertainment sleeping on the AI threat.
,,,"The thing that gets me about Ai is things: . It denies for older actors and artists to truly die, as people with Ai will constantly rehash their work. . In the coming years, it will deny any new talent from coming into the fold, as that will constitute ""risk""."
,,,I'm pretty sure whatever AI keeps making these only knows a handful of actors because it keeps casting the same people in every one
,,,"The film industry as a whole is pretty weird, especially Hollywood is infested by Satanists. In the next to years, we will see a shift in all industry, once AI has passed a maturity cycle. We will longer need a film crew or voice actors,etc. Only the script writer/director"
,,,"When Im asked to express my opinion on the perils of AI, I dont worry much about cheating and the demise of teaching. I worry about things like this and what state actors can and will do with the power of LLMs."
,,,I read her tweet thread last night and it's FRIGHTENING. Surrender your likeness to be used to be AI generated whenever they feel like it? Who would want to watch AI actors over actual human beings anyway - how bizarre would that be? These ideas are just nuts
,,,"Somewhere on my hard drive I have a half-finished novella about a recovered alcoholic who is part of a ""Creator's Guild"" and makes films using expression/gesture actors and AI-generated models and backgrounds. But when he's offered the chance to use a black market AI to recreate"
,,,Theyre going to use AI to write % reality programming that they will then hire all non-SAG actors for. Its a win-win.
,,,Very interesting thread on where AI is heading and the implications for actors
,,,"Yes, the hearing, while in some respects not terrible, was too focused on what COULD happen &amp; how AI might be abused by BAD actors. Pretty silent on present harms &amp; how AI actors, like Altman, are responsible for building a system through exploitative labor practices."
,,,"thousands of actors over the years have played Hamlet theyre all playing a different Hamlet because theyre all distinct, unique individuals who breathe their own life into the words an AI voice generator replicating their vocal patterns isnt giving us a new take on Hamlet"
,,,"People actively involved w AI heartily warning regulations, guidelines, transparency absolutely necessary. Beware of counterfeit people, manipulation, false information, AI hallucinations, bad actors, election manipulation &amp; ordering chemistry to create novel biological agents."
,,,"If I was an actor, this would be frightening. It's a long thread about the threat of AI to actors."
,,,"Tech pioneer Geoffrey Hinton. one of the key people behind AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, recently left Google. He fears AI may be used to create fake or fraudulent content in the future in the future. Learn more: "
,,,"CNews AI will be the end of us: the combination of bad actors and politicians who dont have the capability to understand what is needed to control it means we are, ultimately, screwed. In terms of jobs in the shorter term, though, it shows the need for universal basic income."
,,,This whole thread..Im so glad that I didnt sign with SAG yet because actors along with writers need to be protected and paid. And if more people are going to be using AI for an actors image than people this is going to be a huge problem.
,,,"The movie The Congress is about this very thing, actors signing over their image to be used with AI."
,,,"Hey, actors. This is a slippery slope. How long before your likeness ends up in an AI created porn movie? It's a real possibility, especially if these companies sell your likeness to others. Imagine you're long dead and your grandkids are watching grandma in a gangbang. Beware."
,,,"In addition, the rejection AI is encountering in some areas is a much bigger problem than bad actors taking control of the system. If we can agree to accept it, then we can begin teaching the public. This would provide room for initial information about the good and bad."
,,,"I, naively, though AI wouldn't be a threat to the creatives out there: writers, musicians, artists, actors, etc. Turns out I was very, very wrong."
,,,I see this attempt to license AI as a huge deal. You don't lean into regulatory barriers for new entrants if there's no chance that other actors can follow in your footsteps. You do it if it's relatively easy to do so. OpenAI knows something.
,,,What will be the future once AI will start making movies without actual actors!!!! Whole industry will be affected badly.
